# Active Record Tenanting

This file will eventually become a complete "Rails Guide"-style document explaining Active Record tenanting with this gem.

In the meantime, it is a work-in-progress containing:

- skeleton outline for documentation
- functional roadmap represented as to-do checklists


## Introduction

> [!TIP]
> If you're not familiar with how Rails's built-in horizontal sharding works, it may be worth reading the Rails Guide on [Multiple Databases with Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html#setting-up-your-application) before proceeding.

Documentation outline:

- this gem primarily extends Active Record,
  - essentially creating a new Connection Pool for each tenant,
  - and extending horizontal shard swapping to support these pools.
  - also provides test helpers to make it easy to handle tenanting in your test suite
- but also touches many other parts of Rails
  - integrations for Middleware, Action View Caching, Active Job, Action Cable, Active Storage, Action Mailbox, and Action Text
  - support and documentation for Solid Cache, Solid Queue, Solid Cable, and Turbo Rails
- a Tenant is just a string that is used for:
  - the sqlite database filename
  - the subdomain (or path element)
  - fragment cache disambiguation
  - global id disambiguation
- talk a bit about busted assumptions about shared state
  - database ids are no longer unique
  - global ids are no longer global
  - cache is no longer global
- and what we do in this gem to help manage "shard" state


## Active Record

### Configuration

Documentation outline:

- how to configure database.yml for tenanting a primary database
- how to configure database.yml for tenanting a non-primary database
- how to make a class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base "sublet" from a tenanted database
  - and note how we do it out of the box for Rails records
- how to run database tasks and what's changed
- demonstrate how to configure an app for subdomain tenants
  - app.config.hosts
  - example TenantSelector proc
- explain Tenanted options "connection_class" and "tenanted_rails_records"

TODO:

- implement `AR::Tenanted::DatabaseConfigurations::RootConfig` (name?)
  - [x] create the specialized RootConfig for `tenanted: true` databases
  - [x] RootConfig disables database tasks initially
  - [x] RootConfig raises if a connection is attempted
  - [x] `#database_path_for(tenant_name)`
  - [ ] bucketed database paths
  - [ ] `#tenants` returns all the tenants on disk (for iteration)

- implement `AR::Tenanted::DatabaseConfigurations::TenantConfig` (name?)
  - [x] make sure the logs include the tenant name (via `#new_connection`)

- Active Record class methods
  - [x] `.tenanted`
    - [x] mixin `Tenant`
    - [x] should error if self is not an abstract base class
    - [x] `Tenant.with_tenant` and `.current_tenant`
    - [x] use a sentinel value to avoid needing a protoshard
    - [x] `tenant_config_name` and `.tenanted?`
  - [x] `.tenanted_with`
    - [x] mixin `Subtenant`
    - [x] should error if self is not an abstract base class or if target is not tenanted abstract base class
    - [x] `.tenanted?`
  - [x] shared connection pools
  - [x] all the creation and schema migration complications (we have existing tests for this)
    - [x] read and write to the schema dump file
  - [ ] feature to turn off automatic creation/migration
    - make sure we pay attention to Rails.config.active_record.migration_error when we turn off auto-migrating

- [ ] think about race conditions
  - maybe use a file lock to figure it out?
  - [ ] create
    - if two threads are racing
  - [ ] migrations
    - done in a transaction, but the second thread's migration may fail resulting in a 500?
  - [ ] schema load
    - if first thread loads the schema and inserts data, can the second thread accidentally drop/load causing data loss?
  - [ ] destroy
    - should delete the wal and shm files, too
    - we need to be close existing connections / statements / transactions(?)
      - relevant adapter code https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/91d456366638ac6c3f6dec38670c8ada5e7c69b1/activerecord/lib/active_record/tasks/sqlite_database_tasks.rb#L23-L26
      - relevant issue/pull-request https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53893

- tenant selector
  - [x] rebuild `AR::Tenanted::TenantSelector` to take a proc
    - [x] make sure it sets the tenant and prohibits shard swapping
    - [x] or explicitly untenanted, we allow shard swapping
    - [x] or else 404s if an unrecognized tenant

- database tasks
  - [ ] RootConfig should conditionally re-enable database tasks ... when AR_TENANT is present?
  - [ ] make `db:migrate:tenants` iterate over all the tenants on disk
  - [ ] make `db:migrate AR_TENANT=asdf` run migrations on just that tenant
  - [ ] do that for all (?) the database tasks like `db:create`, `db:prepare`, `db:seeds`, etc.

- old `Tenant` singleton methods that need to be migrated to the AR model
  - [x] `.current` (MOVED to the AR model `.current_tenant`)
  - [x] `.while_tenanted` (MOVED to the AR model)
  - [x] `.exist?`
  - [x] `.current=` (MOVED to the AR model `.current_tenant=`)
  - [ ] `.create`
  - [ ] `.destroy`

- installation
  - [ ] install a variation on the default database.yml with primary tenanted and non-primary "global" untenanted
  - initializer
    - [ ] install `TenantSelector` and configure it with a proc
    - [ ] commented line like `self.connection_class = "ApplicationRecord"`
    - [ ] commented line like `self.tenanted_rails_records = true`

- pruning connections and connection pools
  - [ ] look into whether the proposed Reaper changes will allow us to set appropriate connection min/max/timeouts
    - and if not, figure out how to prune unused/timed-out connections
  - [ ] we should also look into how to cap the number of connection pools, and prune them

- autoloading and configuration hooks
  - [x] create a zeitwerk loader
  - [x] install a load hook

- test coverage
  - [x] need more complete coverage on `Tenant.ensure_schema_migrations`


### Tenanting in your application

Documentation outline:

- introduce the `ActiveRecord::Tenanted::Tenant` module
  - demonstrate how to create a tenant, destroy a tenant, etc.
  - explain `.while_tenanted` and `current_tenant`
- troubleshooting: what errors you might see in your app and how to deal with it
  - specifically when running untenanted


### Testing

Documentation outline:

- explain the concept of a default tenant
- explain `while_untenanted`


TODO:

- testing
  - [x] set up test helper to default to a tenanted named "test-tenant"
  - [x] set up test helpers to deal with parallelized tests, too (e.g. "test-tenant-19")
  - [ ] allow the creation of tenants within transactional tests if we can?
    - either by cleaning up properly (hard)
    - or by providing a test helper that does `ensure ... Tenant.destroy`
  - [ ] a `while_untenanted` test helper


## Caching

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful

TODO:

- [ ] need to do some exploration on how to make sure all caching is tenanted
  - and then we can have belt-and-suspenders like we do with ActiveJob


## Action View Fragment Caching

TODO:

- [ ] extend `#cache_key` on Base
- [ ] extend `#cache_key` on Sublet


### Solid Cache

Documentation outline:

- describe one-big-cache and cache-in-the-tenanted-database strategies
- how to configure Solid Cache for one-big-cache
- how to configure Solid Cache for tenanted-cache

TODO:

- upstream
  - [ ] feature: make shard swap prohibition database-specific
    - which would work around Solid Cache config wonkiness caused by https://github.com/rails/solid_cache/pull/219


## Active Job

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful
- explain belt-and-suspenders of
  - ActiveJob including the current tenant,
  - and any passed record being including the tenant in global_id


TODO:

- [ ] extend `to_global_id` and friends for Base
- [ ] extend `to_global_id` and friends for Sublet
- [ ] extend `ActiveJob` to set the tenant in `perform_now`


## Active Storage

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful
- how to configure Disk Service so that each client is in a tenanted subdirectory
- how to configure S3 so that each client is in a tenanted bucket

TODO:

- [ ] still have to do some exploration here to figure out how best to tackle it
  - and then we can have belt-and-suspenders like we do with ActiveJob (hopefully)


## Action Cable

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful
- how to make a channel "tenant safe"
 - identified_by
- how the global id contains tenant also
- do we need to document each adapter?
  - async
  - test
  - solid_cable
  - redis?

TODO:

- [ ] explore if there's something we can/should do in Channel base case to automatically tenant
  - and then we can have belt-and-suspenders like we do with ActiveJob
- [ ] understand action_cable_meta_tag
- [ ] config.action_cable.log_tags set up with tenant?


### Turbo Rails

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful

TODO:

- [ ] some testing around global id would be good here


## ActionMailbox

TODO:

- [ ] I need a use case here around mail routing before I tackle it
